# Distributed Garbage Collection System in Go

## Vision Statement

The goal of this project is to implement an efficient and fault-tolerant **Distributed Garbage Collection (GC)** system for a **microservices-based environment**. The system will handle the reclamation of unused memory and resources across distributed nodes (or services) to **optimize system performance** and **prevent memory leaks**.

## Background

Distributed systems, especially microservices, present **complex memory management challenges** due to the decentralized nature of resources. In such systems, garbage collection (GC) must be carefully designed to ensure the following:

- **Efficient use of system memory.**
- **Minimal disruption to running services.**
- **Fault tolerance and system resilience.**

This project aims to evaluate different **distributed garbage collection strategies** and implement a system that can manage memory across nodes while addressing these challenges.

## Goal and Objectives

- Develop a **functional, scalable distributed garbage collection system** with a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy in a **microservices architecture**.
- Provide **detailed performance benchmarks** to guide the selection of the best **garbage collection strategy** for specific use cases.

## Project Plan

### Research & Design

- Study **Reference Counting, Mark-and-Sweep, Epoch-based GC, and Distributed Tracing**.
- Define **system architecture** (e.g., microservices, messaging protocols).
- Choose tools & technologies (**Python/Go, gRPC/Kafka, Docker/Kubernetes**).

### Prototype Development

- Implement a **basic distributed GC system**.
- Set up **inter-node communication** for reference tracking.
- Perform **initial testing** for correctness and performance.

### Implement Additional Strategies

- Extend the system to include **Mark-and-Sweep** and **Epoch-based GC**.
- Optimize **synchronization and memory management techniques**.
- Begin **benchmarking** for **latency, memory usage, and overhead**.

### Evaluation & Finalization

- Compare all implemented strategies using **test workloads**.
- Identify **trade-offs** in performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
- Document **findings, challenges, and potential improvements**.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Go, or Java
- **Microservices Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K3s)
- **Inter-Service Communication:** gRPC, Kafka
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Benchmarking Tools:** Locust, JMeter, Custom Profiling Scripts
